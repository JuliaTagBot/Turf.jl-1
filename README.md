# Turf.jl
 ---

##### Julia wrapper of the incredible [*turf.js*](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf) package for spatial analysis.  

*Turf.jl* is almost mapped 1 to 1 with the original *js* version of *turf*. So you can expect a familiar syntax, common coding conventions
and similar ways of doing everything, plus the benefit of using Julia.
